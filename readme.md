I’m Geordie, and this is my *personal* website. I’m an Honours student in linguistics studying at The University of Melbourne, and I’m particularly interested in the Indigenous languages of northern Australia. This website is a work in progress; I aim to update it with presentation materials, papers, and blog posts. <GK>
